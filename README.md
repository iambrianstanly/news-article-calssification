# News Article Categorization

## Overview

This project involves developing a deep learning model to categorize news articles into predefined categories. The model was implemented using Python, with the Librosa framework for data preparation and an LSTM model for classification.

## Features

- **Automated News Categorization:** Classifies news articles into specific categories.
- **Deep Learning Architecture:** Utilizes an LSTM model to capture the sequential nature of text data.
- **Data Preparation:** Librosa was used to preprocess the text data, converting it into a format suitable for model training.

## Dataset
- Kaggle dataset.
